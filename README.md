# Eco Monitor Miami

## Project info
Our objective is to create a web-based monitoring platform that leverages machine learning, remote sensing, and data science techniques to help track and visualize the health of Miami’s ecosystems. From Biscayne Bay pollution to urban deforestation threats, Miami Eco-Watch provides an interactive dashboard for researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand the region’s environmental challenges and protect the natural resources.
