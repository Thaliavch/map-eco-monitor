# Eco Monitor Miami

## Project Info
Our objective is to create a web-based monitoring platform that leverages **machine learning**, **remote sensing**, and **data science** techniques to help track and visualize the health of Miami’s ecosystems. From **Biscayne Bay pollution** to **urban deforestation** threats, **Eco Monitor Miami** provides an interactive dashboard for researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand the region’s environmental challenges and protect natural resources.
